    <h1>IU-ME!</h1>
    <p>
        In 2025, a war broke out. A world war. I am not 100% sure what the cause was or who was right or wrong. It’s too
        confusing and doesn’t really matter. Basically each side used various tactics which caused the female population to
        cease existence such as leaking cyanide into period and beauty products.
        However, there was one woman left alive. She had lived in Invergordon for 15 years and she was nineteen. She was born in
        Wick. She worked as the operations administrator at SEMCO. Somehow she was immune to cyanide. Word broke out of this and
        all the men fled to Invergordon.
        
        The last woman on earth. What the heck was she going to do? She met all the men in Tucker’s Inn.They needed to procreate
        to save Planet Earth. She agreed to having sex with each of them but by her rules or else she would commit suicide and
        there would be no more future for the human race.
