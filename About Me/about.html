    <h1>About Poundland</h1>
    <p>

Poundland was created using the blood, sweat, tears, secretions and jizz of various famous writers who happened to grace
your correspondent’s Goodreads. Poundland is a prebound book which displays its influences as a focal point and takes
various forms. Poundland spans across a number of genres and mediums; erotica, satire, metafiction, autofiction, science
fiction and journalism. There is something for everyone…except children.
