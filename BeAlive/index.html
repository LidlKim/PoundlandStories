    <h1>BeAlive</h1>
    <p>The hospital room smelt of synthetic bodily fluids. The smell overpowered Gremy’s rotten mushroom breath. Gremy’s big
    bug eyes were not popping out as much as they usually were. She was lying there in a daze. Julie was sobbing in the
    corner.
    “Don’t cry Julie. I’ll be fine,” Gremy mumbled.
    “A TIA is not fucking fine Gremy.” Julie had her face in her hands. She was tense all over. Her neck was aching. “I
    can’t believe your body can keep betraying you like that, Gremy.” Gremy did not live the healthiest lifestyle. She loved
    butter and online shopping. She poisoned herself with choco-lebnicks and glasses of Sauvignon Blanc. With sweetness
    comes suffering. With sweetness comes heart disease, diabetes and strokes. And different strokes cause sadness to
    different folks.
    “Things need to change, Gremy! You can’t keep doing this to yourself! I’m sick of visiting you in this place.” Gremy’s
    huge bug eyes started leaking.
    “I know, I know,” she responded.
    
    
    A month later Julie visited Gremy in her bungalow.
    
    “Gremy, I need you to do something for me. I need you to install a software into your mobile. It’s called BeAlive.”
    “Bee-hive? You what?”
    “No BeAlive. Watch- you’ll need to take a photo of yourself each day and send it to me. As a sort of proof of life.”
    “What a ridiculous thing to do!”
    “Please Gremy, I need you to do this!”
    Gremy’s eyes bulged out further. Julie could smell her rotten mushroom breath.
    “Gremy, if you die, I don’t think I can continue on. The world would feel evil and apocalyptic. My whole world would
    cease to exist and it would be replaced with a massive big hole. Gremy you must stay alive for me!”
    “I don’t want to go. This old dog still has life in her. But this BeAlive is stupid. That is not life! It’s pixels.”
    “Please Gremy!”
    “Fine”
    
    Day One of BeAlive and Gremy already forgot. Or had she? Maybe she was slumped over in her seat in the living room
    watching Only Fools and Horses, slumped over her laptop while she was shopping for crocs. Julie sent Gremy a Whatsapp
    message- a link to something on the Hoppertitty community support. Someone complaining about dogs defecating on the
    pavements. “Look at this miserable cow’s post, Gremy,” Julie wrote. Julie didn’t care about the old cow at Hoppertitty
    but she wanted to know that Gremy was alive without asking her directly. For the whole morning Julie kept checking her
    phone and there was no response. She could feel her blood pressure rising. She knew she had to call her. She needed to
    know to stop this sinking feeling.
    She called. No answer.
    Half an hour later. Gremy started ringing her. “Gremy!” Julie answered.
    “What’s wrong? Why are you calling?”
    “You didn’t respond to my message. You didn’t send me a picture on BeAlive!”
    “Bloody Beehive!”
